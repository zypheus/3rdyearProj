# 1. Laravel Overview and Core Concepts

This document covers the fundamental concepts of the Laravel 12 framework, the basic project structure, and deployment information for the **LoanEase** loan management system.

## Background Information

### What is Laravel

- Laravel is a PHP web application framework with elegant syntax and powerful features for building modern web applications.
- It uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to organize code logically and maintain separation of concerns.
- Laravel 12 integrates with Blade (templating), Eloquent (ORM), MySQL (database), and Vite (asset bundling) to create full-stack web applications.
- Laravel's command-line interface (Artisan) provides tools for scaffolding, migrations, and development tasks.
- Vite provides fast asset bundling and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) during development.
- For the most up-to-date and comprehensive information, always refer to the [Laravel Docs](https://laravel.com/docs) -- https://laravel.com/docs

### Supported User Roles (THREE ROLES ONLY)

- **Admin**: Full system access - manage users, view all data, generate reports, system configuration
- **Officer**: Process loan applications, verify documents, approve/reject loans, process requests
- **Member**: Submit loan applications, upload documents, view own application status
- ❌ **NO OTHER ROLES ALLOWED** - Never add LGU Verifier, Employer, Manager, or any other custom role

### Laravel Project Structure

- A Laravel project consists of organized directories: `app/`, `routes/`, `resources/`, `database/`, `config/`, etc.
- The `app/Models/` directory contains Eloquent models that represent database tables.
- The `app/Http/Controllers/` directory contains controllers that handle request logic.
- The `resources/views/` directory contains Blade templates for rendering HTML.
- The `database/migrations/` directory contains migration files for schema management.
- The `routes/web.php` file defines all web routes for the application.
- The `vite.config.js` configures Vite for frontend asset bundling and HMR (Hot Module Replacement).

### The MVC Pattern

- **Model** (`app/Models/`): Represents data and business logic, interacts with the database via Eloquent ORM.
- **View** (`resources/views/`): Blade templates that render HTML, receive data from controllers.
- **Controller** (`app/Http/Controllers/`): Handles HTTP requests, processes data, and returns responses.
- Example flow:
  ```
  Route (routes/web.php) 
    → Controller (app/Http/Controllers/LoanController.php)
    → Model (app/Models/Loan.php)
    → View (resources/views/loans/index.blade.php)
  ```

### Deployment

- Laravel applications can be deployed to various hosting providers (shared hosting, VPS, cloud platforms).
- Common deployment platforms: Laravel Forge, Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode.
- Deployment typically involves uploading code, running migrations, and configuring environment variables.
- Use `php artisan migrate` to apply database schema changes in production.
